# Digital-CMOS-Project

Titled:-SchmittTrigger-based Low Power SRAM implemented using 45-nm CMOS Technology. To undertake the completion of our project, we have broken the work
down into specific tasks as listed below:
/n • Design of Conventional 6T SRAM Cell
• Design of Schmitt-Trigger-Based SRAM Cell
• Read and Write Ports Operations
• Simulation and Analysis
• Static Noise Margin (SNM) Analysis
• Process, Voltage, Temperature (PVT) Analysis
• Performance Comparison with the Conventional 6T SRAM
